Introduction

Hotel Turing is an application that allows a viewer to login to the page and book a room for their stay. The user can search the rooms that are available by date and narrow the search by room type. Once they've booked a room, the room will be added to their account.

This application was written by Lexye Jordan during Mod2 at Turing School of Software & Design.

Challenges and Wins

I was very challenged by the amount of work I had to put into this project. Handling the data after it was fetched took a lot of tinkering and console logging to properly set up the data model. And then getting it hooked up to the DOM was quite the undertaking. Figuring out where to start and what was the priority was my main challenge. In the future I will remember to test my methods before putting them into action.

I am very proud of how far I have come in this project. I'm specifically proud of how my data model is very totally functional without the Dom and that felt like a slam dunk.
